Hello, this is my first application made using tkinter and python. It is a
simple application that anyone can do. If you're reading this I would like
hear your feedback. I am aware that the code is messy and I know I didn't
comment anything but I am sure the code is slef explanitory. Again, like I
said, this is my first application done without following any tutorial and
only based on my knowledge.

The funds.txt is where the balance or amount of money is saved and where
the application gets the funds value.
